                        At IYE, teachers receive recognition and rewards based on their students' achievements.
                        With structured fortnightly feedback, progress assessments, and innovative teaching methodologies, we ensure that both students and teachers thrive together.

                        Additionally, we provide career growth opportunities, skill enhancement programs, and professional development resources that help educators achieve their personal and professional goals.
                        Whether itâ€™s gaining more experience, improving teaching strategies, or building financial stability, we support our teachers in every step of their journey.
